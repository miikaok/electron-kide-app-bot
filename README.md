### The Open Source NextGen Kide.app Ticket Bot.

</div>

The NextGen Kide.app Ticket Bot is a PWA (Progressive Web Application) that allows users to automate the ticket buying experience by using efficient algorithms. This bot offers many different options to make sure you get the ticket you need. Apart from many other bots like this, this bot uses web workers as the way to make the buying process even faster and this way the main thread does not get blocked by a delayed response.

## üë™ Community

I am well aware that sharing this bot might cause some chaos, but in the warm spirit of a student, it is better that everyone can access it. This way, there will be no groups of people with closed source bot programs that will cause other people to not have their tickets.

## üõ†Ô∏è API

I am willing to update this bot regularly if it needs some upkeep at this point in time. Bugs will be fixed as soon as possible, but I am not sure if there will be further functional improvements to the bot.

## üìö Project stack
  - **Runtime:** Electron
  - **Language:** JavaScript
  - **Testing:** Coming soon...
